# First Year Lensing Project

This is where I'll upload materials for the First Year Gravitational Lensing project.

### Project Goals

By the end of the project we should aim to achieve most of the
following:

- Use NumPy and SciPy to build a robust gravitational lens model
- Vary source position, size, shape, brightness
- Vary lens mass distribution, ellipticity, rotation angle
- Use Python Image Library to lens photos
- Plot images and sources in Matplotlib

### Reading List

Some papers covering different aspects of lensing:

* (https://github.com/conor-or/first-year-lensing/raw/master/docs/dissertation.pdf)[My MSc Dissertation] has all the lensing theory we'll need. Of use to us is the stuff in the first half of chapter two.
